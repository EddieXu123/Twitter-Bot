# Twitter-Bot
Day 6 of 10! This bot will Tweet motivational/inspiring messages morning, reply with a nice message to anyone who @s it, and finally give Coronavirus updates every 8 hours on, including symptoms, prevention, and treatment.

I took a different approach with this bot, using Twitter's own Tweepy API and developer mode instead of Selenium/Chromedriver. Thanks Twitter!
